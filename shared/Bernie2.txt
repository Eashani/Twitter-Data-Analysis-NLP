We need to stand up for @AndrewYang, @BernieSanders, and @TulsiGabbard against these establishment corporate tools. We don't have to agree with every word a candidate says to protest their marginalization. #BoycottMSNBC

This entire #BoycottMSNBC movement is far bigger than just my preferred candidate showing up on a graph. (3/5)

There is a defined way to protest and violating the law isn‚Äôt acceptable. Pulling a ‚ÄúJane Fonda‚Äù never solved anything. This was a televised game that an unplanned delay cost lots of money. It incites more.
