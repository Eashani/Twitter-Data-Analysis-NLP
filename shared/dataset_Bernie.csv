And regarding your other comment, re: FBI visiting Huff, if it *has* gone to that level - and I agree it should - then why TF is Twitter allowing his tweet?

1200482725448343557,2019-11-29 18:32:40,"@Vashie812 @disruptionary @BernieSanders Well, I do care about welfare, because if I'm investing in their education, safety, and economic success I'm happy to see them making better decisions driven by economic forces. We have a tax on alcohol and cigarettes right? Those are also regressive taxes that impact the poor.

I live in NJ. Corey Booker has be lining his pockets for years with the pharma companies. I essence we can afford it because congress forces us to! We look at other countries with corruption but our own!Look at the net worth of congress. Even Bernie

Given assumptions made about @realDonaldTrump and Ukraine, an equal measure assumption to conclude motives of contenders leaves them forced to recuse themselves. Put that in front of a judge!

He lost 6 campaigns tho. All while not supporting his son being raised by a single mom on welfare.
